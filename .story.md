### MVI & Clean Code: Rendering Logic of State in Flutter : Riverpod story : Polishing to Shine with Clean Code and Conclusions


#### Polishing to Shine with Clean Code.


But there is no limit to perfection. To be just like adults, and there was less to explain in the third part, we will transfer the data 
(counters) to where they should be - to the data sources ([Data source](lib/presentation/manager/counter_view_model.dart:16) 
in the corresponding [Repository](lib/data/repository/Repository.dart:4) and, accordingly, access to them will be through the corresponding 
[Use Case](lib/domain/usecase/UseCase.dart:3) interface

##### Conclusions

All together, in my experience, this helps to build systems that are not ashamed to look at after six months, and in the git blame there is no desire to say, "Its not me" )
