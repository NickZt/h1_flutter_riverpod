### MVI & Clean Code: Rendering Logic of State in Flutter : Riverpod story : Now app broken down


This is pretty much the same basic counter application as Flutter created by default, but with all the state and logic removed.
[MyHomePage](lib/main.dart:30) is StatelessWidget instead of StatefulWidget. What happens if you launch the application?
Check it yourself, the application has stopped working, pressing the FAB does not lead to anything. It's no surprise if the [onPressed](lib/main.dart:50) callback of the FAB button does nothing.
