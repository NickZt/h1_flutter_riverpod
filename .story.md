### MVI & Clean Code: Rendering Logic of State in Flutter : Riverpod story : time to add View States

For complete MVI view we need to add view states, in Kotlin we add it in sealed class.
Creating a union/sealed class

These kind of simple data classes are enough in themselves to use freezed but the elegance with which you can create unions
 is just  magnificent. If you used any other sealed class wannabe packages,
 you know about their weird syntax or limitations.
 Let's again take a look at the grace of Kotlin's sealed classes:
 
 '''
 sealed class ViewStates {
  object Odd : ViewStates()
  object Even : ViewStates()
}
'''

in render simple do that:

'''
fun render(viewState: ViewStates) {
        when (viewState) {
            is ViewStates.Odd -> {
                showOddState()
            }
            is ViewStates.Even -> {
                showEvenState()
            }
            
        }
    }
'''
Even if you know nothing about Kotlin, you should understand what's going on. 
Can we replicate this to and make it done with freezed? I bet we can! 

Simply add freezed to Flutter/dart project and see result.


Result is simple -- compiler error. How to eliminate this -- see on Next
