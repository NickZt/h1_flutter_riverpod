### MVI & Clean Code: Rendering Logic of State in Flutter : Riverpod story : Providers chains1


And now let's cast the KISS spell over this code. This will improve our ability to build provider chains.
Let's add [_evenCounterProvider](lib/main.dart:19). This provider does almost the same thing as [_evenCounterProviderAsSeparateState](lib/main.dart:11) but without unnecessary
 and completely automatic. It is easy to see that as soon as the value of the provider [_isEvenProvider](lib/main.dart:7) [changes to true]((lib/main.dart:21)), then one is added to the value
 of our provider ([_evenCounterProvider](lib/main.dart:19)). This is also possible)
