### MVI & Clean Code: Rendering Logic of State in Flutter : Riverpod story : Add new feature


The application works. Let's try to add a feature - let us have another counter that will show how many even numbers the user has seen.
We will solve the problem head-on. Let's add to the counter, let's call it [EvenCounter](lib/states/even_counter.dart:31), every time Counter is divisible by two without a remainder.
And then we start [EvenCounterNotifier](lib/states/even_counter.dart:18) and [EvenCounterModel](lib/states/even_counter.dart:31) by analogy with Counter.
as a provider in full analogy with [_counterProvider](lib/main.dart:16)  [_evenCounterProviderAsSeparateState](lib/main.dart:11) 

We will also create a provider of the state property [_isEvenProvider](lib/main.dart:7)

It will transmit on an even or odd number if the [_counterProvider](lib/main.dart:16) value has changed.
We noticed earlier that it is not optimal to redraw the widget every time the provider changes. Since new providers pass values ​​twice less often than [_counterProvider](lib/main.dart:16), we will create new widgets for new providers:
[CounterIsEven()](lib/main.dart:84) and [EvenCounter()](lib/main.dart:94). Their system can redraw only when the corresponding provider passes values.
