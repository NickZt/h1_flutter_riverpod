### MVI & Clean Code: Rendering Logic of State in Flutter : Riverpod story : Providers chains
### MVI & Clean Code: Rendering Logic of State in Flutter : Riverpod story : time to cast Clean Code spell



â€œThe first 90 percent of the code takes 10 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code takes the remaining 90 percent." Tom Cargill, Bell Labs

Clean architecture is the most powerful solution for building systems in which multiple teams can work on independent layers of code. 
Scalability for add / remove components, verifiable, easily replaceable components, easy to maintain throughout any life stage of an application.
On the suggested reading list this section includes: "The Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)"

#### Back to busines

Let's remove all unnecessary from the class files and place them in the appropriate packages (directories, package), calling them in connection with Clean Architecture:

* [main.dart](lib/main.dart) remove unnecessary code to a better place
 
* [counter_widget.dart](lib/presentation/widgets/counter_widget.dart) group widgets into package /presentation/widgets /

* [home_page.dart](lib/presentation/pages/home_page.dart) to the page package (analogous to fragment from android) and the entire structure of the application will resemble the Single Activity approach


* [counter_view_binding.dart](lib/presentation/manager/bindings/counter_view_binding.dart) select provider binding in a separate file in presentation / manager / bindings package

* [counter_model.dart](lib/data/models/counter_model.dart) transfer models to the data layer
