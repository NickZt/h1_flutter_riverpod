### MVI & Clean Code: Rendering Logic of State in Flutter : Riverpod story : View States render contract

Add a contract for the [View](lib/presentation/pages/home_page.dart:17), which is responsible for the states and the logic of their display. 
The methods for switching the View to different states are defined in the contract and described in the View, 
which implements the [ViewStatesRenderContract](lib/presentation/manager/view_states_render_contract.dart:5).
 (This is a mixin) The states themselves are in [ViewsState](lib/presentation/manager/bindings/views_state.dart:10).
