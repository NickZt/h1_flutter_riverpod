### MVI & Clean Code: Rendering Logic of State in Flutter : Riverpod story : The ViewModel has arisen

"our providers become bloated god classes with state and business logic thrown all over the place." 
 Somewhere in Reddit

#### The problem and why we complicate things.

We need to understand that the provider is a very simple and easy to explain state management tool, 
especially for newbies, but I just don't understand how using such singletons in application development can lead to a clean architecture. 
Not to mention not being able to use any of the methods in my providers without jumping through hoops. 
It makes no sense for me to build clean architecture or die trying. If you have one provider per page (or area) like [ViewModel](lib/presentation/manager/counter_view_model.dart:9), 
then it can't really become a big god class. It should only contain the models of this page and some methods. 
This way, you can easily call [notifyListerns](lib/presentation/manager/counter_view_model.dart:47),  whenever you do something with your models, instead of calling it from inside the model. 
In addition to this, you can have service classes that have nothing to do with the provider and only contain logic.


Dig deeply into [ViewModel](lib/presentation/manager/counter_view_model.dart:9)

In all places of the widget, we call methods from [ViewModel](lib/presentation/manager/counter_view_model.dart:40) e.g. this one is called when the big fab button [is pressed](lib/presentation/pages/home_page.dart:20) 
In subwidgets we call direcly counters [EvenCounter](lib/presentation/widgets/counter_widget.dart:23) and [Counter](lib/presentation/pages/home_page.dart:36) in Even State and in Odd state [Counter](lib/presentation/pages/home_page.dart:53)

And yes, you can see that the order of the widgets changes when the state changes.
At the same time, so as not to kill the clock , we added the [logic for switching states](lib/presentation/manager/counter_view_model.dart:45) to our view model. 


And after all this code looks simple and easy to understand
